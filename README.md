# yum-repo-mooz
The mooz repo

### Overview

My attempts at building RPM packages for programs I need. Hopefully they are of use to others.

Using this repository assumes that you are also using the [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) repo.

### Repository highlights

**Kodi requires the ffmpeg package which I cannot host at the moment. Consider enabling the [epel-multimedia](https://negativo17.org/multimedia/) repository in this case.**

**The openrazer driver has known problems with the stock CentOS kernel. In order for the driver to function properly on the stock kernel a workaround must be put in place (see [#3](https://github.com/moozhub/yum-repo-mooz/issues/3#issuecomment-408646741)). However, installing the latest `kernel-ml` package from [Elrepo](http://elrepo.org/tiki/kernel-ml) is another easier option if you're not interested in setting any workarounds.**
